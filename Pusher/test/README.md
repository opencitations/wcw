# Pusher test
_Tests are built using the builtin module of Python named `unittest`. Please, refer to [its documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/unittest.html)
in case of issues._

Tests for the Pusher step are fully contained in this folder. They can be simply run with the following commands:
```bash
cd <path>/Pusher
python -m unittest discover
```

If everything goes well, an 'OK' message is printed in the end.
